# Analysis Security Levels

A large part of the StopInjection modules is the ability to determine whether or not a targeted usage is secure or not. To aid in comprehension for the reports generated by the modules we have a standard when analyzing source code. This document details the meanings of the terms that you'll encounter when working with the codebase or consuming reports generated by the codebase. There are three security levels: Secure, Insecure and Susceptible. While these are pretty self-explanatory check out the details below for more information.



## Secure

We have determined this usage is secure against the vast majority of vulnerabilities.
