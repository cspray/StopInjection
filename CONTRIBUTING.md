# Contributing

I encourage people to contribute to the project and will do whatever I can to make contributing to this project as seamless and painless as possible.

 ## Coding Standards

 I have my own set of coding standards that I use and you can review at [`cspray/coding_guidelines`](http://github.com/cspray/coding_guidelines). If your code is consistently using [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) standards I could be persuaded to accept this style as well.

## Third party dependencies

I intentionally have relatively few dependencies on third party libraries in this project.
